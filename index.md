# About Me
I am an engineering student who likes to play with data and dig deep into it to draw infernces and come up with unique solutions.
I believe in open source libraries and that everyone must get access to its content while making necessary changes. Currently I am working with YellowBrick, a data visualization library which aids in exploratory data analysis for a deploying a successful machine learning model.
